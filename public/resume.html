        <p>
            Resourceful and forward-thinking engineer with over 6 years of experience in DevOps, 
            automation, and system orchestration—now specializing in AI agent creation and workflow 
            automation. Proven ability to design and implement multi-agent systems using platforms like 
            CrewAI, n8n, and Make.com, integrating with LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral) for intelligent task execution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Skilled in multi-shot and one-shot prompting, building context-aware agents that can 
            perform business processes autonomously—such as data scraping, email parsing, customer 
            response generation, and real-time decision-making. Strong foundation in Python for scripting, 
            API integration, and orchestrating workflows across cloud environments. Looking to bring 
            cutting-edge automation to teams that need scalable, AI-driven solutions for real-world operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey began in traditional DevOps and customer engineering, where I built CI/CD pipelines, 
            managed cloud infrastructure, and provided technical support. This foundation in system administration, 
            automation, and customer service has been invaluable in developing AI solutions that solve real-world problems.

            <div class="project-description">
                • Designed a modular multi-agent framework using CrewAI with agents assigned roles like Researcher, Planner, Executor, and Reporter to handle long-form task flows.<br>
                • Implemented multi-shot prompting and memory chains to ensure context continuity across sub-agents.<br>
                • Used LangChain tools to let agents access a custom toolkit (search, API calls, file system writes).<br>
                • Built a web API interface using FastAPI to trigger workflows and manage agent output, deployable via Docker.<br>
                • Integrated n8n to schedule runs, capture inputs, and notify users via Slack/Email.<br>
                • Result: Created a reusable system for research automation and report generation—no human supervision required.

            <div class="project-description">
                • Built a support agent system that monitors incoming emails and helpdesk tickets, categorizes them, and drafts initial replies using GPT-4.<br>
                • Used n8n for automation flow: trigger → classify intent → generate response → send draft to human for approval.<br>
                • Make.com handled fallback workflows like escalation and CRM updates based on classification confidence.<br>
                • Integrated with Airtable to log all ticket activity, performance analytics, and feedback loops.<br>
                • Result: Reduced human agent workload by ~60%, improving first-response time and reducing backlog.

            <div class="project-description">
                • Created an offline voice agent that performs desktop tasks using natural language (open apps, control mouse, read email).<br>
                • Integrated with local LLM for command parsing using prompt chaining techniques.<br>
                • Used Coqui for speech-to-text and TTS feedback, with command execution handled via Python's PyAutoGUI.<br>
                • Developed prompt templates for one-shot commands and multi-step task chains.<br>
                • Result: Privacy-friendly voice interface, usable without internet and ideal for secure local systems.

            <div class="project-description">
                • Developed an automated agent that pulls meeting transcripts, task lists, and project notes from Notion and formats them into clean, shareable weekly reports.<br>
                • Used LangChain agents with memory and prompt templates to parse raw input and structure executive summaries.<br>
                • Incorporated document loaders and embeddings to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from past context.<br>
                • Deployed trigger via n8n every Friday afternoon with Slack alert to managers.<br>
                • Result: Fully hands-off status reporting; saved 5–7 hours/week for leadership team.
